Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Juel, a Biology graduate who's transitioning into Software Engineering. Through self-study and enrolling in a coding Bootcamp at Manchester Codes, I am building a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies and languages. You can find me on tech twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/j_brgnz">j_brgnz</a> where I'm currently enjoying  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=hashtag_click">#100DaysOfCode</a> and <a href="https://edabit.com/challenges">Edabit</a> challenges.
